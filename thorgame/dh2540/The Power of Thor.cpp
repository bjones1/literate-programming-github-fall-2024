// When I first opened this assignment, I looked at the description of the
// project\
// in order to understand what was being provided for me, and what I needed to
// do.\
// The description tells us that Thor needs to go to The Light to receive its
// power.\
// Thor and the Light are placed in two different coordinates in the x and y
// plane.\
// The programmer needs to create a loop that will guide Thor to The Light.\
// The programmer is given all the variables and code required, meaning the\
// only worry is the loop, specifically the while loop.

// The solution that I came with after writing all the important information\
// down was to create 8 if-else statements for each movement. Thor can\
// only move in the North, East, South, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast,
// Southwest.\
// Thor has a limited number of turns to reach The Light and he can only move\
// one cell each turn. Each if-else statement has two conditions, one for the\
// x coordinate and one for the y coordinate. When one of these coordinates is\
// satisfied, Thor moves one cell in that direction and then the loop restarts\
// This will go on until Thor has the reached The Light.

// <mark> CAG:</mark> I Think the program in the IDE and in Codechat both read very well.
// I might would consider adding a resources section at the bottom but that again is just preference.
// The main change I would make would be to put your code into the given code and present it as 
// one cohesive program.
