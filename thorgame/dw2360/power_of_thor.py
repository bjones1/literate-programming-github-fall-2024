# # Power of Thor Game: [Codinggame.com](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/power-of-thor-episode-1)
#
# ## **Game Objective**
#
# Use the compass directions to move Thor 1 cell in either direction to reach
# the light of power.
#
# You lose by Thor running out of energy or running off the map (40 x 18 grid).
#
# ## **Approach**
#
# > The conditional statements begin with comparing Thor's initial XY position
# > to where the light of power's XY position is located.
#
# > The grid's coordinates begin at the top left corner with X = 0 & Y = 0.
#
# > This makes the bottom right corner have the coordinates: X = 39 & Y = 17.
#
# > If Thor's position is to the left of the light of power, then Thor must go
# > East hence his position should increase by 1 to reach the light of power.
#
# > Going West would decrease by one, and going North would decrease by 1 since
# > Thor's Y position would be greater than the light of power.
#
# > Going South would increase by one, and similar rules would apply for
# > directions: SE, SW, NE, NW
#
# > #### _Note_: Not all directions are provided since the test cases only required a minimum number of directions.
#
# ### **Variables**
#
# - _light_x_: the X position of the light of power
# - _light_y_: the Y position of the light of power
# - _initial_tx_: Thor's starting X position
# - _initial_ty_: Thor's starting Y position
#
# ### **Fixes**

#
# ## **Solution**
light_x, light_y, initial_tx, initial_ty = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

# Game loop
while True:
    remaining_turns = int(input())  # The remaining amount of turns Thor can move. Do not remove this line.

    # Write an action using print To debug: print("Debug messages...",
    # file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
    if initial_ty < light_y & initial_tx < light_x:
        initial_ty = initial_ty + 1
        initial_tx = initial_tx + 1
        print("SE")

    elif initial_ty < light_y & initial_tx > light_x:
        initial_ty = initial_ty + 1
        initial_tx = initial_tx - 1
        print("SW")

    elif initial_ty > light_y:
        initial_ty = initial_ty - 1
        print("N")

    elif initial_tx < light_x:
        initial_tx = initial_tx + 1
        print("E")

    elif initial_tx > light_x:
        initial_tx = initial_tx - 1
        print("W")
