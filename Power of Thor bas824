// # The Power of Thor: Literate Code

// Game [here](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/power-of-thor-episode-1)

// ## Overview

// This program was made for the codigame: The Power of Thor (Linked above) The
// game has a beacon where the character, Thor, must move to. Only the position
// of the beacon is given in light_x and light_y. Thor only has so many moves he
// can take to get to the beacon, so the most direct path must be found.
// Additonally, he can fall off the map, ending his quest and failing the game.

// To accomplish this, I used an if-else check for each value, _light_y_ and
// _light_x_ respectively. A flow chart of this logic can be found below. I made
// it do that Thor's position was updated with each change of X and Y, making it
// possible to keep track of him so he dosen't 'fall off' the map. Once the
// if-else is finished the X and Y values are added together to make a smooth,
// and in some cases, diagonal line to the goal. This had to be done becasue a
// limited about of 'moves' were given and simply changing the X and Y
// seperatly, one at a time, would take up all the moves.

// ## Keeping Track of Values

    int light_x; // the X position of the light of power
    int light_y; // the Y position of the light of power
    int initial_tx; // Thor's starting X position
    int initial_ty; // Thor's starting Y position
    cin >> light_x >> light_y >> initial_tx >> initial_ty; cin.ignore();
    int ThorX = initial_tx;
    int ThorY = initial_ty;

// ## Game Loop
    while (1) {
        int remaining_turns; // The remaining amount of turns Thor can move. Do not remove this line.
        cin >> remaining_turns; cin.ignore();

        string X = "";
        string Y = "";

// ## Finding Position
//
// See flow chart at the top of the file for detailed logic


// ### Find Y position
        if(ThorY > light_y){
            Y = "N";
            ThorY -= 1;
        }
        else if(ThorY < light_y){
            Y = "S";
            ThorY += 1;
        }

// ### Find X position
       if(ThorX > light_x){
        X = "W";
        ThorX -= 1;
       }
       else if (ThorX < light_x){
        X = "E";
        ThorX += 1;
       }

// ### Output Position
//
// #### Note: Outputing tells the character where to move, it is not just text in a box
       cout << Y << X << endl;        

    }
