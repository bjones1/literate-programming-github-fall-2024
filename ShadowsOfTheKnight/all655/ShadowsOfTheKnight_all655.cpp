// ## The puzzle I chose was *<a title="Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1</a>*
//
// ### How I went about solving this puzzle:
//
// At first, I began by coding. I just read very carefully through the
// instructions that stated what the program was supposed to do. I then realized
// I would need if-statements for each possible direction that the bomb may be
// (Up, Down, Left, Right, Up-Left, Up-Right, Down-Left, DownRight). Note the
// direction of the bomb was given by a device that Batman was holding, which
// was given through the string variable bomb_dir. At this point I hit a mental
// block and ran out of time as I was not sure yet how I would configure each
// if-statement. Normally I would keep trying and experimenting until something
// concrete came to mind. At this point, which was about 15 minutes, I made
// some notes/drawings, which are shown at the end of this document.
//
// When I wrote out my ideas on paper as instructed in step 4 (see
// [Coding with Reflection assignment instructions](https://canvas.msstate.edu/courses/133359/assignments/1257462)),
// it became clear what I needed to do as well as helped me realize scenarios
// that I had not considered beforehand. I essentially solved the problem by
// using a box or four separate variables as boundaries, which encompassed the
// points that the bomb could be in, and points outside of the box’s boundaries
// were eliminated from the realm of possible points. For example, if the
// direction of the bomb is up-left (UL) of Batman, then I know that all points
// below Batman (DL, D, DR) and above as well as to the right of Batman (U, UR)
// are out of the realm of points to consider, so in this case, the bottom right
// corner of the box would be where Batman is currently positioned when informed
// that the bomb is UL. If the bomb was located DR (Down-Right) of Batman,
// Batman’s current position would be the top-left of the box (see **Figure
// 1**). I basically created a binary search but for **two** dimensions without
// using an array. Using an array might have been much cleaner and concise but
// doing it this way made more sense for me. In my code, I kept the box’s
// position updated, so it would essentially shrink any which way with each jump
// that Batman made. Whenever Batman jumped, he would jump to the center of the
// box every time until he discovered the bomb. Please see the code for more
// details as well as the following figures/notes.

// <img style="border-style: ridge;" title="notes3.jpg" src="notes3.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700">

// In this sketch, I realized what the math would look like or involve to find
// the center of the “box”. This was the moment that I grasped it was just some
// simple algebra.
//
// ## The code is as follows:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;
