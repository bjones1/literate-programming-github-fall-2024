#
# ## **Problem Breakdown**
#
# The goal of the puzzle is to identify the tallest mountain among eight and
# output its index. We are using a **linear search algorithm** to find the
# maximum height and its corresponding index. The solution is split into
# sections for initialization, looping through the input, checking conditions,
# and finally printing the result.

# ## **Linear Search Algorithm**
#
# The **linear search algorithm** is a simple method for finding a particular
# value (in this case, the maximum height) in a list of values (the mountain
# heights). The algorithm works by starting from the first element in the list
# and sequentially comparing each element to the current maximum value. If the
# element being examined is larger than the current maximum, it updates the
# maximum. The search continues until all elements have been checked.
#
# **Why Linear Search?** Linear search is intuitive and straightforward, which
# makes it well-suited for small datasets like the eight mountains in this
# puzzle. Although more efficient algorithms such as binary search exist, they
# are unnecessary here because:
#
# 1.  The list of mountain heights is small, with only eight elements, making
#     the simplicity of linear search a good fit.
# 2.  Linear search works well with unordered data, as in this case where the
#     mountain heights are not pre-sorted.
# 3.  It has a time complexity of **O(n)**, meaning it performs a single pass
#     over all elements, which is efficient given the limited size of the input.

# ## **Flowchart Overview**
#
# Below is a flowchart that visually represents the algorithm used to solve the
# problem:

# ## **Pre-Writing Reflections**
#
# Before writing the code, I recognized that the solution could be easily
# represented with a flowchart. Visualizing the process allowed me to break down
# the task into smaller, manageable sections. By dividing the problem into steps
# such as initialization, looping through inputs, checking conditions, and
# outputting the result, the coding phase became much more structured and
# simplified.
#
# I also anticipated potential issues with variable initialization, which could
# cause logic errors if not handled correctly. This led me to think through how
# to initialize the variables in a way that would ensure proper comparisons and
# updates within the loop.

# ## **Initialization**
#
# Before diving into the loop, we need to initialize two variables:
#
# 1.  **max_height**: This stores the maximum height encountered so far.
#     - Initialize it to -1, ensuring no mountain will have a smaller height.
# 2.  **max_index**: This tracks the index of the highest mountain.
#     - It starts at 0, and will be updated as we find higher mountains.

max_height = -1  # Initializing max_height to a value lower than any possible height.
max_index = 0    # Initializing max_index to 0 to indicate the first mountain.

# ## **Main Loop**
#
# The main loop will iterate over the heights of all eight mountains provided in
# the input. Each mountainâ€™s height is processed one at a time using a `for`
# loop. Inside the loop:
#
# - We read the current mountain's height.
# - We compare this height to `max_height`. If the current mountain's height is
#   greater than `max_height`, we update both `max_height` and `max_index`.

while True:
    for i in range(8):
        # Read the height of the current mountain.
        mountain_h = int(input())  # Input the height of each mountain
        
        # ## **Condition Check**
        #
        # If the current mountain is taller than the stored maximum
        # (`max_height`), we update:
        #
        # - `max_height` to the current mountain's height.
        # - `max_index` to the index of this mountain.
        if mountain_h > max_height:
            max_height = mountain_h  # Updating the maximum height encountered so far.
            max_index = i            # Storing the index of the tallest mountain.
    
    # ## **Result Output**
    #
    # After evaluating all mountains, the index of the tallest mountain is
    # printed. This step happens after all comparisons are done for the current
    # round of input.
    print(max_index)  # Output the index of the tallest mountain to be shot at.

# ## **Post-Coding Reflection**
#
# The code implements a simple **linear search algorithm** that finds the
# maximum value in a set of eight numbers (mountain heights). This algorithm
# runs in **O(n)** time complexity, meaning that the time it takes to complete
# the search grows linearly with the number of elements. Since we're only
# processing eight mountains, this is optimal for the task at hand.
#
# The **linear search algorithm** was chosen because:
#
# - It is straightforward and easy to implement.
# - The number of elements is small (only 8 mountains), so a more complex
#   algorithm would not add significant value.
# - Linear search does not require the list to be sorted, which makes it ideal
#   for our input.

# **Insights gained during coding**: Initially, it was important to ensure that
# the variables were initialized correctly. I set `max_height` to -1, which made
# sure that any mountain height would be greater than the initial value. This
# approach helped streamline the logic inside the loop. Another important
# realization was ensuring that every mountain was checked exactly once, and the
# correct index was captured. The simplicity of the linear search allowed me to
# easily identify and resolve logical errors during the testing phase.
#
# **Reflecting on the process**, planning the solution with a flowchart first
# made the coding process smoother and more efficient. Breaking down the problem
# into smaller steps (initialization, looping, condition checking, and output)
# clarified the solution in advance, reducing the need for debugging during
# implementation.
