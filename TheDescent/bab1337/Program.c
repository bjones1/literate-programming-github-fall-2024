   ## Code explanation

   The point of the game is to shoot at a mountain from a ship thus destroying the mountain.
   The _while(1)_ loop is what runs the game. Each iterative run of the loop is
   a turn in the game in which there will be an _input_ of the mountains and the
   _output_ to fire at a mountains. The inputs take in the mountain's height and the corresponding's mountain's index number,
   with currentMountain integer recording the Mountain's index number, that is the highest mountain's number. The output
   Is the number of the mountain with the highest height and will thus be fired upon.

               hold the same value that _currentMountain_ does. _currentMountain_ holds the _i_ or the _index_ not the _mountain_height_ provided by the input.
