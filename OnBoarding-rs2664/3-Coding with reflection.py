# ### <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Comprehension of the Problem:</strong></em></span>
#
# The task involves comparing the Euclidean distances between a reference point
# (representing our position) and two enemies, situated in a one-dimensional
# space. The objective is to determine which enemy is closest, as this
# represents the most immediate threat.
#
# ###       <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Initial Thoughts:</em></span>
#
# To clarify the problem, the scenario was conceptualized as occurring within a
# Euclidean space, where two enemies are positioned at distinct points. The task
# is to ascertain which enemy is nearer by evaluating their respective distances
# from the reference point. A straightforward condition check was then
# considered, wherein the distances of the two enemies are compared, with the
# enemy having the shorter distance being identified as the immediate threat.

 # 1.  **Input**: The program takes the names and distances of two enemies as
 #     inputs.
 # 2.  **Comparison**: It compares the two distances.
 # 3.  **Output**: The program prints the name of the closest enemy.
