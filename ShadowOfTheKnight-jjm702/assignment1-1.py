# # assignment1.py -- Python Solution for _"Shadow of the Knight - Episode 1"_

# <mark> dw2360: I suggest adding what the game is about here for context.  
# The objective is clear, but things to consider:  
# - <mark> What is Shadow of the Knight?
# - <mark> Why do I care about finding the bomb? (See picture below for example) </mark>

# <mark> dw2360: Consider adding a subheading here maybe like "**_Objective_**". </mark>

# This Python program is designed to solve the puzzle
# _[Shadow of the Knight - Episode 1](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1)_
# from Codingame. The objective of this puzzle is to **guess the coordinates of a
# bomb in a 2D array** by making guesses based on feedback provided in the form
# of directional hints.

# <mark> dw2360: The sentence above is redundant to the problem statement,
# so consider adding the Shadow of the Knight URL to the problem statement and renaming it to "**_Objective_**".  
# Also, I added an 's' to coordinate. </mark>

# ## **Problem Statement**

# The goal of this puzzle is to **determine the location of a bomb within a
# rectangular grid**. You start with a guess and receive feedback on the
# direction of the bomb relative to your current position. You must adjust your
# guesses accordingly while **minimizing the number of attempts**.

# ### **Rules**

# The heat-signature device provides directions based on your current position:  
# <mark> dw2360: You could put: '...based on your current position _and the general direction towards the bomb_' for clarity. </mark> 
# - **U** (_Up_)
# - **UR** (_Up-Right_)
# - **R** (_Right_)
# - **DR** (_Down-Right_)
# - **D** (_Down_)
# - **DL** (_Down-Left_)
# - **L** (_Left_)
# - **UL** (_Up-Left_)

# Your mission is to **move Batman to the most likely position of the bomb in
# the fewest moves possible**. The building is represented as a grid where the
# top-left corner is at index (0,0).

# Below is an image depicting the basics of the problem with Batman on a random
# (x, y) and the bomb somewhere on the grid. The search interval is based on the
# direction given, which in this example would be 'UR':

# ![Example Grid](grid_plot.png)

# ### **Approach**

# Understanding the problem involves recognizing that the provided direction
# **reduces the possible search area**. The approach uses binary search
# principles to efficiently narrow down the potential locations of the bomb.

# - **Initial Setup:** Define the boundaries of the search area based on the
#   dimensions of the building.
# - **Direction Handling:** Update the search area boundaries according to the
#   given direction.
# - **Position Update:** Move Batman to the midpoint of the updated search area.
# - **Iteration:** Continue until the bomb's location is determined.

# Below is a block diagram illustrating the approach:  
# <mark> dw2360: the '_if bomb found_' in the block diagram should be scooted over a bit for clarity. </mark>

# ## **Solution**
#
# ### **Main Game Loop Explanation**

# In the main game loop, the solution adjusts the search interval based on the
# directional hints parsed from the `bomb_dir` input. Each iteration begins by
# receiving feedback on the bombs relative position. This feedback is a string
# of characters such as "U" (Up), "D" (Down), "L" (Left), or "R" (Right), which
# indicate the direction in which the bomb is located relative to Batmans
# current position. By parsing these characters, the search area boundaries are
# updated accordingly: for instance, if the feedback includes 'U', it suggests
# that the bomb is above Batman, so the upper boundary (`ymax`) of the search
# area is adjusted downward. Conversely, if the feedback includes 'D', the lower
# boundary (`ymin`) is adjusted upward, indicating that the bomb is below.
# Similarly, 'L' and 'R' adjust the left and right boundaries of the search
# area. After updating the search boundaries based on these directions, Batmanâ€™s
# new position is recalculated to be the midpoint of the updated search area.
# This recalculated position is printed, guiding Batman to the next guess, and
# the process repeats until the bomb is located. This method ensures that each
# guess progressively narrows down the search area, efficiently converging on
# the bomb's exact location.

# ### **Imports**

```python
import sys
import math


# ### Initilization

# #### w: width of the building. h: height of the building.  <br><mark> dw2360: Instead of a period, you could use a comma after '_building_' and before '_h_' for uniformity. </mark></br>
w, h = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

# #### Maximum number of turns before game over.
n = int(input())  

# #### Starting coordinates for Batman <br><mark> dw2360: For uniformity, you could add a period(.) after each description as you did above. </mark></br>
x0, y0 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

# #### Custom boundaries for search area
xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax = 0, w - 1, 0, h - 1

# <mark> dw2360: Consider eliminating one or two of these spaces for uniformity with the rest of the page. </mark>


# ### Main Game Loop

while True:
# #### Direction of the bombs from Batman's current location <br><mark> dw2360: For uniformity, you could add a period(.) after each description as you did above. </mark></br>
    bomb_dir = input() 

# #### Narrow the search range based on the direction
    if 'U' in bomb_dir:
        ymax = y0 - 1  
    if 'D' in bomb_dir:
        ymin = y0 + 1  
    if 'L' in bomb_dir:
        xmax = x0 - 1  
    if 'R' in bomb_dir:
        xmin = x0 + 1  
    
# #### Update Batman's position to the middle of the new search area
    x0 = (xmin + xmax) // 2
    y0 = (ymin + ymax) // 2
    
# #### Print the location of the next window Batman should jump to
    print(x0, y0)
